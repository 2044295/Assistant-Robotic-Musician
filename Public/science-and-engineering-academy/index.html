      Software engineering is a subject area that I am generally comfortable
      with. I spend a lot of my free time writing and experimenting with
      programs, including the one written above, a sample of the NodeJS code
      behind this site. I am familiar with Python, Bash, JavaScript / NodeJS,
      and C/C++, though I do most of my experimental programs in Python/C/C++.

      While I am not nearly as comfortable or proficient at aerospace
      engineering (or orbital mechanics), this is another area that I am very
      interested in learning about. The screenshot above is from the game
      <i>Kerbal Space Program</i>, in which one builds and flies rockets.

      I have recently started to take more of an interest in Game Design. When
      I was much younger, I really enjoyed video games such as <i>Legend of
      Zelda: The Wind Waker HD</i> and <i>Pokémon X</i>, and started playing
      around on game-design websites such as <a href="https://scatch.mid.ed">
      Scratch</a> &mdash; which was actually my first introduction to
      programming. I quite enjoyed it, and made a few playable games, such as
      <i>Target Flight</i>, above, which uses the mouse to fly and the space bar
      to shoot.

      <br />
      <br />

      Becoming busier in high school, I stopped playing and developing games,
      but have recently remembered how much I enjoyed them before. I may never
      be a professional, but the area is nonetheless one that I am
      interested in experimenting in, and maybe working on in my free time.
