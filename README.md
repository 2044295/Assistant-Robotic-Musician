# Assistant Robotic Musician

> To address the difficulty musicians face when performing without an assistant
  or deskmate, we will create an Assistant Robotic Musician (ARM) which can
  fulfill the same role more efficiently and less intrusively. The ARM will be a
  device into which one can place sheets of music or a booklet of sheet music,
  and it will use on-board software to process live audio of the performance and
  automatically determine when to flip the page. It will include clips on either
  side to hold the sheet music open (solving an auxiliary problem experienced by
  musicians playing from a book) and an efficient system responsible for
  grabbing and flipping the page. It will also come with free, compatible
  cross-platform software to process digital sheet music and upload the
  processed file to the ARM so that the integrated software can follow the
  performance. We hope to make this a collaborative effort, inviting musicians
  to write sheet music compatible with the ARM. Together, we hope to ease the
  process of performing with sheet music by removing distractions and
  difficulties in handling the music.

### About This Repository
This repository contains the online presence of the Assistant Robotic Musician,
an engineering project (specifically, a Senior Capstone Design Project) that
aims to create a device which seamlessly and automatically turns the pages of
sheet music as a musician performs.

Specifically, this repository contains, or will contain, two separate but
connected projects: The various scripts that make up the software component of
the ARM, and the code that deploys the ARM's webpage:
