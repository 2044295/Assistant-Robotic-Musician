# Assistant Robotic Musician

> To address the difficulty musicians face when performing without an assistant
  or deskmate, we will create an Assistant Robotic Musician (ARM) which can
  fulfill the same role more efficiently and less intrusively. The ARM will be a
  free, open-source, cross-platform application into which one can load sheets
  of music or e-booklets of sheet music, with embedded software to process live
  audio of the performance and automatically determine when to flip the page.
  Additionally, it will automatically process scanned sheet music, as well as
  allow for editing, storing and organizing these processed files in a vast
  library. Furthermore, the eponymous, friendly AI, “Arm,” will manage both the
  library and the performance software. We hope to make this a collaborative
  effort, inviting musicians to write sheet music compatible with the ARM.
  Together, we hope to ease the process of performing with sheet music by
  removing distractions and difficulties in handling the music.


### About This Repository
This repository contains the online presence of the Assistant Robotic Musician,
an engineering project (specifically, a Senior Capstone Design Project) that
aims to create a device which seamlessly and automatically turns the pages of
sheet music as a musician performs.

Specifically, this repository contains, or will contain, two separate but
connected projects: The various scripts that make up the software component of
the ARM, and the code that deploys the ARM's webpage:
